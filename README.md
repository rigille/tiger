# modern-compiler-implementation-in-c
I will implement Appel's compiler with some differences.
* I'll use C++ instead of C, in order to have templates and make algebraic datatypes easier to make
* Programs will be parsed with monadic style parsers
* Functional-style immutable data structures will be preferred with automatic reference counting to manage memory
