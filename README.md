# modern-compiler-implementation-in-c
I will implement Appel's compiler with some differences.
* I'll use Rust instead of C, in order to have polymorphism and make algebraic datatypes easier to make
* Programs will be parsed with parser combinators
* Functional-style immutable data structures will be strictly adhered to
